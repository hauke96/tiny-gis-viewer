# TinyGisViewer

A tiny web-application to view geospatial data.
The core idea is to have no dedicated server other than a simple HTTP webspace.
Configuration takes place in a JSON file on your webspace and the data comes from external OGC services.

## Development

Run the application locally with `ng serve`.
